# Tetris for the TI-84 Evo-T

A colour Tetris game for the **TI-84 Evo-T** graphing calculator, written in Python.

> **Made with AI:** this game and this README were created with the help of AI (Claude by Anthropic).
> Everything was tested on a real TI-84 Evo-T.

## Features

- 7 coloured pieces
- **Ghost piece**: a grey shadow shows where the piece will land
- **Next** piece preview
- Score, lines and levels: every 10 lines the pieces fall faster
- **High score** that stays saved after you quit
- Start screen, pause and "play again"
- No flicker

## What you need

- A **TI-84 Evo-T** calculator
- A USB cable to connect it to your computer
- **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** (Safari and Firefox do not work with the TI tool)
- The file [`tetris.py`](tetris.py) from this repo

## Setup

1. Download [`tetris.py`](tetris.py) to your computer.
2. Connect the calculator to your computer with the USB cable.
   Leave the calculator on the **home screen**.
3. Open **https://connectevo.ti.com** in **Chrome** or **Edge**.
4. Connect to your calculator in the page and allow access when the browser asks.
5. Drag `tetris.py` onto the page to send it to the calculator.
6. **Choose RAM** to play right away.
   The Python app on the Evo-T only shows files that are in RAM.

> **Already sent it to Archive?** On the **home screen** (not in the Python app) press **2nd → mem → Mem Management**,
> find **TETRIS** and press **enter**. The `*` in front of the name disappears, which means
> it is now in RAM.

## Start the game

1. Open the **Python** app on the calculator.
2. Choose **TETRIS** and run it.
3. Press **enter** on the start screen.

## Don't lose the game

The Evo-T **deletes RAM** when it stays turned off for a while.
A normal turn-off is fine, but after some time the game is gone.

**Best way:**

1. Keep the game in **Archive**. Archive is never deleted.
2. Go to the **home screen**. If you are in the Python app, leave it with **2nd → quit**
   (quit is above the **mode** key). In the Python app, **2nd → mem** does nothing.
3. Press **2nd → mem** (mem is above the **+** key) and choose **2: Mem Management**.
4. Choose the list with Python programs (or **All**).
5. Find **TETRIS** and press **enter**. The `*` disappears, which means the game is now in RAM.
6. Open the **Python** app and play.

Programs can't move files between Archive and RAM by themselves, so this step can't be automatic.
The high score list **TETRS** is in RAM too, so it can be deleted the same way.

## Keys

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| ◀ ▶ | Move left / right |
| ▲ | Turn the piece |
| ▼ | Fall fast for a moment (tap again to keep going) |
| enter | Drop the piece to the bottom |
| 2nd or mode | Pause (2nd or enter to go on) |
| clear | Quit |

## Points

| Action | Points |
|---|---|
| ▼ fast fall | 1 per row |
| enter drop | 2 per row |
| 1 line | 100 × level |
| 2 lines | 300 × level |
| 3 lines | 700 × level |
| 4 lines | 1500 × level |

## High score

The best score is saved in a calculator list called **TETRS**, so it stays after you quit.

- To reset the high score, delete the list **TETRS** in **2nd → mem → Mem Management** (on the home screen).
- A calculator reset (RAM clear) also resets it.

## Good to know

- Keep `tetris.py` on your computer too, so you can always send it again.
- Made for the TI-84 Evo-T. Other TI-84 models are not tested.
